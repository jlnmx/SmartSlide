# **The Water Cycle: An Introduction**

The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is the continuous process by which water is circulated between the Earth and the atmosphere.
*It is a vital process that sustains life on our planet.*

---

# **Key Terms**

*Evaporation*: the process by which water is converted from its liquid to its gas state.
*Condensation*: the process by which water vapor in the air is cooled and changed back into its liquid state.
*Precipitation*: the process by which water falls to the Earth's surface in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

# **The Water Cycle Process**

1. **Evaporation**: Water from the oceans, lakes, and rivers evaporates into the air as water vapor.
2. **Condensation**: Water vapor in the air cools and condenses into tiny droplets, forming clouds.
3. **Precipitation**: Water droplets in the clouds become too heavy to remain suspended, and fall to the Earth's surface as precipitation.
4. **Collection**: Precipitation collects on the ground, in oceans, and in other bodies of water, and the cycle begins again.

# **Case Study: Water Scarcity**

In many parts of the world, water scarcity is a pressing issue. Droughts, climate change, and population growth are all contributing factors.
Understanding the water cycle is crucial for developing effective solutions to this problem.
